# What is this?

FEPDF is a Java program made by me for a particular client that needed some automation on his daily repetitive tasks. So, basically the goal of this humble program is improve the workflow of the client. This is the first version. FEPDF takes some PDF's and fills those PDF with the user input.
For the graphical stuff I used Swing library. For the PDF manipulation I used Apache PDFBox library.
